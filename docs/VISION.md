# Our vision

We are dedicated to advancing the ERC-4337 ecosystem and promoting decentralization in the bundler network.

Our long-term goal is to encourage bundler diversity in the ecosystem and empower others to run their own bundler nodes.

The project's primary focus:
- Provide a reliable and secure bundler node that is easy to use and deploy.
- Maintain 100% compatibility with the ERC-4337 bundler-spec-test to help prevent p2p mempool fragmentation.
- Experiment with new bundler features that optimize bundler performance and security.
