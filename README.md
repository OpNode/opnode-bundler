## Project status
> :warning: **This repository is currently under active development.**
See our road-map [here](https://hackmd.io/@V00D00-child/SyXKL6Kmn#Project-StatusRoadmap-)

## üì• Installation
```bash
npm install
```

## üöÄ Development
Everything you need to get started developing with the Bundler.

#### Run local ETH Node
```bash
npm run eth-node
```

#### Deploy ERC-4337 contracts and fund bundler signer account
```bash
npm run bundler-prep
```
Use this script to:
- deploy the entry point contract to the local eth node.
- deploy simple account factory contract to the local eth node. 
- Fund the bundler signer account with ETH.

#### Start Bundler node 
Copy values in `.env.sample` into `.env` and fill in the values with your own.

```env
MNEMONIC=test test test test test test test test test test test junk
INFURA_API_KEY=<your-infura-api-key>
ALCHEMY_API_KEY=<your-alcemy-api-key>
BENEFICIARY=<address_to_receive_funds>
WHITE_LIST=<address_to_whitelist_SEPARATEDBY_COMMA>
BLACK_LIST=<address_to_blacklist_SEPARATEDBY_COMMA>
PEER_MULTIADDRS=<multiaddrs_of_peers_SEPARATEDBY_COMMA>
```

1. Ensure that the ETH node is running, ERC-4337 contracts are deployed, and the bundler signer account is funded.
2. Ensure that you populate `.env`  with your own.
3. Pick a mode to run the bundler; see the table below for details.

|   Mode  |    Script   | Validation | Bundle strategy |
|:-------:|:-----------:|------------|:---------------:|
| address | `npm run `    |            |                 |
| balance | `npm run` |            |                 |

The bundler will start on `http://localhost:3000/rpc`.

## üß™ Test

npm run test
```

## üîç Lint
