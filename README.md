## üöÄ Development

Everything you need to get started developing with Transeptor.

### Run local development
1. `git submodule update --init`
2. Use correct node version `nvm use`
3. Add `PRIVATE_KEY` to `contracts/.env` file to deploy the entrypoint contract locally.
4. Install dependencies `yarn install`
5. Start local eth node `yarn local-eth` - Will also deploy the entrypoint contract please wait for environment vars to be printed in the console and copy it to the nodes `.env` files.
6. In a new terminal window start the bundler node with live watch for local dev. `yarn dev`

- The `relayer` node will start on `http://localhost:4337/rpc`. 
- The `bundle-builder` node will start on `http://localhost:4338/rpc`.

You can now make changes to the code and each node will automatically restart.

#### Local dev e2e scripts 

Make sure both `relayer` and `bundle-builder` nodes are running before running to to send a userOp through the bundler

```bash
yarn send-op
```

### Test

```bash
yarn test
```

### Lint

```bash
yarn lint
```

or

```bash
yarn lint:fix
```

## Build

You can build Transeptor from source or use the Docker image.

### üîß Run from source
1. Use correct node version: `nvm use`
2. Install dependencies: `yarn install`
3. Build `bundler-relayer` and `bundler-builder` nodes: `yarn build`

Now let's start the bundler nodes.
```bash
./transeptor-builder
./transeptor-relayer
```

### üê≥ Run from Docker images

Build images
